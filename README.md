zoomable
========

This is a basic implementation of zoomable vector drawings using svg and [wheelzoom.js](https://github.com/jackmoore) from Jack Moore.

[Demo](http://www.longsection.com/drawings/18)

The included .svg file is from the ICA in Boston.

Best way to export .svg is through Adobe Illustrator, "SAVE AS", ".svg"
